# KMP Sandbox

A sandbox project to explore Kotlin Multiplatform.

This is not intended to be a guide or anything related. I'm just trying to explore what's possible, the current state of the framework/tools, etc. But I'll do my explorations here in an open way, so it may be useful to other people.

## Initial Goals

1. To have a buildable empty project on Android and iOS with a single shared module
2. To have an empty screen (Compose-based on Android, SwiftUI-based on iOS) consuming a single method from the shared module
3. millions of intermediate steps
4. A working client for the Reddit API. Why Reddit? Because I find their API a bit too much complex. So it would be a good exercise to consume it in a clean way.
